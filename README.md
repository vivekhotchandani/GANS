# **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Experiments**  

## **Overview**  
This repository contains experiments on **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, focusing on training deep learning models to generate realistic images. The experiments explore different GAN architectures, training techniques, and dataset applications.  

## **Installation**  
Clone the repository and install dependencies:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/GAN.git
cd GAN
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Running Experiments**  
Each experiment is organized in its own directory. Follow the README inside each folder for specific instructions.  

## **General Training Pipeline**  
- **Dataset Preprocessing**: Load and normalize images.  
- **Model Definition**: Implement generator and discriminator networks.  
- **Training**: Adversarial training between generator and discriminator.  
- **Evaluation**: Generate images and track performance.  

## **Future Work**  
- Add more advanced GAN architectures.  
- Experiment with different datasets and training optimizations.
